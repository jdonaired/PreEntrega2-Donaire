 <p>OCTOBER 26, 2022 – Rihanna – the global icon, designer, entrepreneur, philanthropist, and the top-selling digital singles artist of all time – makes her highly-anticipated return to the airwaves this Friday with “Lift Me Up,” the lead single from the upcoming Black Panther: Wakanda Forever original soundtrack.

    “Lift Me Up” was written as a tribute to the extraordinary life and legacy of Chadwick Boseman by Tems, Oscar winner Ludwig Göransson, Rihanna and Ryan Coogler. The song was recorded in five countries and was produced by Göransson.
    
    The release of “Lift Me Up” ushers in the next era of Rihanna’s iconic career. “Lift Me Up” will be released this Friday, October 28th via Rihanna’s own Westbury Road label in partnership with Roc Nation, Def Jam Recordings and Hollywood Records.
    
    “After speaking with Ryan and hearing his direction for the film and the song, I wanted to write something that portrays a warm embrace from all the people that I’ve lost in my life. I tried to imagine what it would feel like if I could sing to them now and express how much I miss them,” said Tems. “Rihanna has been an inspiration to me so hearing her convey this song is a great honor.”
    
    In Marvel Studios’ Black Panther: Wakanda Forever – one of the most highly anticipated film events of the year – Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett), Shuri (Letitia Wright), M’Baku (Winston Duke), Okoye (Danai Gurira) and the Dora Milaje (including Florence Kasumba) fight to protect their nation from intervening world powers in the wake of King T’Challa’s death. As the Wakandans strive to embrace their next chapter, the heroes must band together with the help of War Dog Nakia (Lupita Nyong’o) and Everett Ross (Martin Freeman) and forge a new path for the kingdom of Wakanda. Introducing Tenoch Huerta Mejía as Namor, king of a hidden undersea nation, the film also stars Dominique Thorne, Michaela Coel, Mabel Cadena and Alex Livinalli.

        THE ROOTS, 'HOW I GOT OVER' (2010)
        By 2010, Philly-based rap group the Roots were solidly at the top of rap’s underground, conscious wing. Their ninth album, How I Got Over, manages to burst through any stifling expectations with one of the group’s most adventurous offerings. The Roots’ signature live instrumentation is at its most resonant, and the album’s themes of societal degradation and struggle in the face of economic and political turmoil remain as potent as ever. —J.I.
